        <h2>Let me introduce myself!</h2><br><br>
        <h2  style="display: inline;">Hello, my name is </h2><h1  style="display: inline;">Sharon.</h1><br>
        <p>I am a San Diego native that made my way up to Davis for college. Upon graduating with a communication major and psychology minor, I didn't have a clue about what I would be doing next. I eventually found myself teaching English in Korea. I enjoyed being around children, and it was hands down the best three years of my life! I got to experience my culture as well as visit different parts of Asia that I hadn't been to before! It was awesome.</p>
        <p>But, I knew that I needed another plan. I knew that I couldn't stay in Korea forever and gave myself a limit of a few years. It was a somber parting, but I eventually made my way back to California. When I came back, I started working for nonprofits and marketing agencies doing social media marketing. I hated it. I have nothing against it, but I knew that it just wasn't for me.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I found myself dabbling into the world of design and playing around with Illustrator and Photoshop. Interested in taking classes, I took the IMCP and FEWD program at SDCE. The FEWD program has taught me a lot and challenged me in many different ways. I am very happy that I had the chance to exercise my creative side along with learning how to code and build websites from the ground up. I would love to use the skills I have learned to create a custom and personal representation of your brand and product on the interwebs!</p>
