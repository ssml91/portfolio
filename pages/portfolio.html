     <p>As a student in the FEWD program, we had several assignments that we completed over the course of the class. We covered a lot of ground from HTML and CSS to Sass and Javascript.</p><br><p>For this particular assignment, it was specifically based around creating a website that worked responsively. It was a great way to learn about and practice using media queries first hand. We were asked to create a website that was responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p><br>
     <p>When given this assignment, it was obvious that I wanted to base the website around a topic that I enjoyed. What bette subject than dogs! Corgis at that! It was great to play around with the design and layout of this website. I even got to practice embedding a YouTube video into the mix. It was also our first time playing around with flexbox and grid. I have to admit that it was a challenge to get the three rows of descriptions in the middle to align well in the fullscreen view of the site. After testing out different pixel values and One thing I could have done better is to make the nav bar a little cleaner by creating a hamburger menu.</p><br>
     <p>All in all, I am satisfied with the final product and glad to have worked through all the challenges!</p>

   <h1 style="text-align: center; display: inline;">Suzanne Collins</h1><h2>A WEBSITE REDESIGN</h2><br>
    <p>Another one of our class projects was a website re-design. We were asked to re-make a pre-existing website that looked like it could use some help. We were given 2-3 partners to complete this project. We broke down the elements needed on the site and created task cards, whipped up moodboards, and coded away! This was a great project to work on our HTML and CSS, as well as work on building a website with others.</p><br>
    <p>The website we chose to revamp was Suzanne Collins' website. Collins is most known for her best selling novels turned into movies, the Hunger Games. Despite how well known she may be for her novels and movies, her website definitely needed a refresh! Some of the most prominent areas that needed work were her home page and works page. There was text that was colored white that could not be ready by the audience and the works page wasn't a complete showcase of her works. So, we got to work! Those were the areas that we focused on the most. We also added an events page that showcased some ficticious events so that it would catch the eye of her fans that might want to meet her.</p><br>
    <p> One of the biggest challenges was making sure that all of our code came together smoothly. It was quite a challenge to work on the project together and make sure that everyone's code wasn't clashing and was all working together harmoniously. I was in charge of integrating all of the files together and making sure that all was well.</p><br>
    <p>For our webhosting, we decided to go through a free resource called 000webhost. It provided us with exactly what we needed and put us live on the interwebs! One thing that we couldn't seem to get rid of though was their logo on some of our pages. However, it all turned out great. Overall, I am very happy and proud of the final product that my team and I were able to come up with!</p>
